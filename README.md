## Ubuntu server with i3 dotfiles

This project installs the i3 window manager and other development related tools
on a fresh Ubuntu Server 18.04.1 LTS (might work with newer versions though).

Run `setup.sh` as root to setup the system specific stuff. It will end with a
reboot.

Run `setup_user.sh` as a normal user to setup the dotfiles and oh-my-zsh.
